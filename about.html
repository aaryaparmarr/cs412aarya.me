    <div class="about-text">
    <p>Hi! My name is Aarya Parmar. I am a Computer Science major at <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/index.html">Texas A&M University</a>, currently a junior
        with a minor in Statistics and Business. My academic journey has been strengthened by coursework in areas
        such as Discrete Computing Structures, Digital Electronics, and Data Structures and Algorithms, which
        have equipped me with a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of computing. My
        technical skill set includes programming languages and tools such as Azure Synapse, SQL, Git,
        PySpark, Java, Python, and JavaScript, as well as experience with circuit schematics, agile methodologies,
        and various Microsoft Office tools. I am multilingual, fluent in Gujarati, Hindi, Spanish, and English.
    </p> <p>
        My professional experience includes internships at Bank of America and Chevron Corporation, where I
        applied my skills in software and data engineering to real-world projects. At Bank of America, I focused on
        translating client requirements into technical designs, particularly in the area of network security
        automation. During my time at Chevron, I worked on recreating a SeaCargoCharter table using SQL,
        Postman, PySpark, and Azure Synapse, ensuring compliance with industry regulations and collaborating
        with machine learning engineers and data scientists to deploy critical business solutions.
        </p> 
        <p>In addition to my internships, I have completed many personal and group projects that demonstrate my
        ability to apply technical knowledge creatively. One of my notable projects is "Wordle Unlimited," a Javabased game developed using Java FX, CSS, and Scene Builder. You can view this project <a href="https://github.com/aaryaparmarr/wordleproject.git">here.</a> Another significant project is
        "MoneyMaster," a financial literacy application that my team and I developed within a 24-hour hackathon
        challenge, earning recognition as the "Best Beginner Hack." I have also created a Yoga Schedule Builder
        app using Shiny (R) and Python, which allows users to generate personalized yoga schedules based on
        their health concerns and available time.
        </p>
        <p>Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I am involved in extracurricular activities. As
        the Treasurer of <a href="https://www.awics.org/">Aggie Women in Computer Science.</a>, I secure sponsorships and foster relationships with
        companies to support events and initiatives. I have also previously served as the Service Officer and
        Corporate Events Officer. Additionally, I served as the SWELites Education Committee Co-Chair for the
        Society of Women Engineers, where I organized workshops to help freshmen develop essential engineering
        skills and secure internships and scholarships. To learn more about Society of Women Engineers at Texas A&M please click <a href="https://www.swetamu.com/">here.</a></p>
        
        <p>
            During my journey in technology, I had the unique opportunity to participate in a cloud computing program abroad in Singapore. 
            This experience not only enhanced my technical skills but also exposed me to diverse cultures and global perspectives. 
            Collaborating with peers from different backgrounds helped me develop a deeper appreciation for teamwork and innovation on an international scale, 
            shaping me into a more adaptable and culturally aware individual.
