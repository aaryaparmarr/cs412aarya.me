        <p>My technical skills include a wide range of programming languages, development tools, and methodologies,
            reflecting a solid foundation in both software and data engineering. I am proficient in languages such as
            <b>Java, Python, SQL, and C++,</b> which have allowed me to complete complex programming challenges and
            develop clean and efficient solutions. My experience with Azure Synapse, PySpark, and cloud computing
            platforms has further improved my ability to work with large-scale data, ensuring that I can handle
            everything from data ingestion to analysis and reporting. Additionally, I am proficient in web development
            technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabling me to create user-friendly interfaces and
            applications.

        </p>
        <p> I have an interest in <b>data science, health tech, and artificial intelligence (AI)</b>. My interest with data
            science stems from its ability to uncover patterns and insights from amounts of information, which
            can be leveraged to solve complex problems across many industries. I am drawn to the
            intersection of data science and health tech, where I see potential for improving healthcare
            outcomes through data-driven decision-making. Projects like my Yoga Schedule Builder app reflect this
            interest, as they combine my passion for health tech with my technical skills in data processing and user
            interface design.
        
        </p>
            <p>
                AI is another area that interests me due to its impact on technology and society.
                The ability of AI to learn, adapt, and solve problems autonomously opens up endless possibilities for
                innovation. I am excited to explore how AI can be integrated with data science and health tech to develop
                intelligent systems that enhance human well-being and efficiency. Whether it's using AI to predict health
                trends or developing algorithms that drive financial literacy tools, I am passionate about harnessing the
                power of these technologies to create solutions that make a real difference.

                I have also had the opportunity to attend the <a href="https://ghc.anitab.org/">Grace Hopper Celebration 2023</a>, a Women in Technology Career fair where I was able to 
                learn from and network with many women in various industries. This year I will be attending the <a href="https://we24.swe.org/">Society of Women Engineers Career fair (WE24)</a>.
